# restaurant-website

This is a personal project. This website was created by using:
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. SASS (SCSS)
4. JS

I'm using this website as a milestone in my journey into becoming a good web developer. I'm currently following a CSS/SASS course on Udemy and I wanted to see how much I have learned. This website maybe subjet to change in the future.
